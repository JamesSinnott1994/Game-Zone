The player initially assumes control of one of three Roman families; other non-Roman factions can be unlocked later. Gameplay is split between real-time tactical battles and a turn-based strategic campaign. Within the campaign, players manage the economy, government, diplomacy, and military of their faction and attempt to accomplish a series of objectives on a map that encompasses most of Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. On the battlefield, the player controls groups of soldiers and uses them to engage in combat with enemy forces.",

With the summoning of The Old One, a colourless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them, lost their minds - left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained.\" Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight, are never seen again.

With GTA IV having taken place in a decidedly east coast sort of setting in Liberty City, this game takes things over to the west coast. The action takes place in Los Santos and the surrounding countryside of San Andreas. Los Santos has seen better days. A sprawling metropolis full of faded stars, self-help gurus and desperate celebrities, the city has declined somewhat in the face economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. In need of a big score are Franklin, a former street-level gangster; Michael, an ex-con living the high life in witness protection and Trevor, who's a bit on the sociopathic side. These are the three characters through whose eyes you'll see Los Santos. Of course, you'll do a lot more than looking around. The game is centred around six big heists, with plenty of driving, shoot-outs and other assorted missions to get stuck into in between. The open world map is huge, with hours upon hours of content on offer. If you should happen to get through it all, however, there's a whole other side to the game. GTA V also gets you access to GTA Online, a sprawling persistent world for you and up to 15 other players to play in either cooperatively or against each other in traditional competitive modes. With the next-gen version, players get the advantage of higher levels of detail than have ever been seen in GTA before, with better draw distances, finer texture detail and denser traffic to make the city seem more vibrant than ever.",

            "description": "As the 2019/2020 season kicks into high gear, EA's FIFA series is back with a host of improvements and one big new twist on its classic formula. With FIFA 20 EA Sports is taking the beautiful game back to the streets for a more casual, creative version of the sports know and love. Pitches are swapped out for courts and cages, sponsored kits are swapped out for casual-wear and tight formations and tactics are swapped out for a more dramatic style of play that's fast and fancy. Configurations include 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 modes, as well as rush, where there's no keeper. Less obvious but no less important are changes that have been made under the hood. EA has been playing around with the pillars of how matches move and flow, crafting what it calls Football Intelligence around 'decisive moments' (play on the ball); 'authentic game flow' (off the ball) and ball physics (which sort of explains itself). As ever, fidelity to real world elements of the game is a big part of FIFA. The UEFA Champions League; UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super Cup are all present, accounted for and fully licensed, complete with official broadcast overlays, kit badges, match balls and trophies. Returning fans will also be glad of returning modes including FIFA 20 Ultimate Team, Career Mode, a standalone Champions League Mode. Basically, EA Sports FIFA 20 is the full package!",

            "description": "After jaunts to every-when from the 1970s to the far-flung future, the Call of Duty series is returning to its roots with Call of Duty: WWII. Once again players will take to the battlegrounds of Europe in a bid to oust the evil of National Socialism from the world, but this time out they'll be doing it on the hardware of 2017 and with the benefit of lessons learned from multiple series installments. Activision and Sledgehammer Games are aiming squarely at the goal of delivering a gritty, cinematic World War II experience. You'll storm the beaches on D-Day, march across France to liberate Paris and ultimately push on for the invasion of Germany. There's even, in multiplayer, a map that offers players a chance to fight in Blitz-torn London. While the series is clearly going back to its roots in one sense, Sledgehammer has clearly learned from the games between the last CoD set in WWII and now. Most obvious is the inclusion of all the usual killstreaks, but CoD aficionados will also note the likes of turret gunning from Modern Warfare 2; maps with a hint of Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare's momentum-driven layouts to them and paratroopers who call back to World at War's attack dogs. There are certainly new additions too, however. War mode is a new narrative-driven multiplayer mode that has Allied and Axis forces clash in team-driven assault and defend missions. Headquarters, meanwhile, is a new social and competitive experience for players, with activities like 1v1 fights, anti-aircraft gunnery and eSports viewing available. Call of Duty: WWII also introduces Nazi Zombies, an all-new co-op experience with its own storyline set against the backdrop of World War II.",

            "description": "As the football season kicks into high gear another entry into the world's biggest footy videogame lands on our screens, complete with a host of improvements and updates. One significant change is to dribbling. There's a whole load of technology and jargon you might hear about, but what it boils down to is this - improvements brought about using the Frostbite Engine and what EA's calling 'Real Player Motion Technology' mean that dribbling is more fluid than ever. Players naturally twist, tap and squirm as your thumb does the same on the analog stick, far more quickly than in previous games. The Journey makes a comeback, with this outing getting the dramatic moniker 'Hunter's Return'. It continues the career mode from the last game, with save data transfers meaning you can pick up right where you left off as you guide Hunter through his next season with your chosen club. This time out, however, Hunter's no longer a green newcomer and will have to contend with a host of new challenges. The inclusion of Cristiano Ronaldo as a voiced character is rather tantalising, too... Live Substitutions don't sound like they ought to be a big change, but for fans of playing online they'll represent a big shift. Because no-one likes to be the one to press pause when they're playing against their friends, subs tend to be foregone and over the course of the game the game slows as players get sluggish. With the unobtrusive pop-up of a small graphic, however, you'll now be offered the opportunity to swap out a flagging player for an AI-chosed alternative or a pre-set choice you made before kick-off. A couple of big changes have been made to the look of the game that are sure to make an impact to the overall feel, too. While in the past attention has been made to getting the look of different stadia right, this time EA has paid a lot of attention to the feel of them. The light changes as you move from, say, an English ground to a South American one, while the crowds will react differently too. Another big push on the visual front comes in the form of faces, with EA aiming to deepen the authenticity with more realistic modelling than ever. 2017/18 is promising to be a big season for FIFA.",

            "description": "Activision and its developers have been inching towards science fiction with the Call of Duty franchise for years now, but with Infinite Warfare they've finally taken the plunge. In the campaign mode you play as Captain Reyes, a Tier 1 Special Operations pilot at the helm of the Retribution, one of Earth's last remaining warships, in a conflict not just for our planet, but for the whole solar system. See, in Infinite Warfare's future the Earth's resources are spent and our world relies on colonies spread across the solar system to provide it with resources. Not all the colonies are happy with this set-up, though, and the fascist SetDef, hardened by years in extreme environments, seeks to control these outposts and put a stranglehold on the countries of Earth. It's into this conflict that you step. As is befitting this interplanetary set-up, the action takes place across a wide array of environments that bring their own twists on gameplay. In particular, Infinity Ward has included zero-g combat, in which players can move around using a grappling hook and attempt to outflank their enemies. One example is a rapidly-spinning, airless asteroid that's repeatedly baked in searing sunlight. It doesn't get much more tense than that... Another big addition is the Jackal, a futuristic fighter jet that players can take control of. This backdrop will bring brand new challenges to the game's multiplayer, with maps that are designed to leverage tweaks to Call of Duty's movement system for faster, more frenetic play than ever. All this sci-fi action means we get an interesting twist on zombies mode. Zombies in Spaceland takes players back in time to a 1980s amusement park with its After Life Arcade, Fate & Fortune Cards and brand new team mechanics. The Legacy Edition comes with a huge extra treat, too. Modern Warfare Remastered is packed in there, bringing the Call of Duty classic to current generation consoles with a graphical overhaul, iconic campaign and 10 fan favourite multiplayer maps!",

The influential and vicious Santa Blanca drug cartel has turned the country into a narco-state, leading to lawlessness, fear, injustice, and violence. The cartel is on track to becoming a major underworld power and global threat. An all-out war is not the answer. A surgical, stealthy, lethal approach is the only way to stop the disease at its source. The Ghosts, an elite US Special Forces team, are sent behind enemy lines to wreak havoc, destabilize, and eventually break the alliance between the cartel and the corrupted government. Facing an almighty enemy in a massive and hostile environment, the Ghosts will need to make critical moral choices and engage in tough battles to complete their mission - their grittiest and most dangerous operation to date. Features Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands is a military shooter set in a massive, dangerous, and responsive open world that you can play entirely solo or in four-player co-op. BIENVENIDOS A BOLIVIA From the infamous Death Road to the world's largest salt flat and lush jungles, journey through Ubisoft's largest open world action-adventure game to date. Discover massive regions inspired by Bolivia and South America, and enjoy their stunning vistas and incredible diversity. Explore the hundreds of villages, landmarks, and legends populating this country and immerse yourself in Bolivian culture. Cross paths with inhabitants reacting to their own agendas and to the game's day-night cycle and weather system. Explore the wildlands on or off road, in the air, and at sea with over 60 different vehicles, including armored pickups, supercars, dirt bikes, helicopters, and RIB boats just to name a few. BECOME A GHOST Lead a team of four Ghosts, the absolute best of the US military. Play either solo or with up to three of your friends online in this gritty adventure as they seamlessly join you at any point in the game. Engage all your missions in whatever order and manner suits you: stealth, distraction, and tactical or frontal assault always remain possible. Use the new iconic drones to recon the toughest terrains and to tag enemy outposts, or transform them into destructive weapons. Make difficult but critical choices: sabotage, interrogation, kidnapping, and assassination are but a few of the options available for you to reach your objectives. Create your very own ghost thanks to multiple customization options and upgrade your character with the experience and loot you gather on the battleground. TAKEDOWN THE SANTA BLANCA CARTEL The Santa Blanca cartel and its infamous leader, El Sueño, are the most powerful, treacherous, and imposing foes the Ghosts have ever faced. Your mission is to take the cartel down and put an end to their rule of terror by any means necessary: destroy their production facilities, cut off their trafficking routes, dismantle their influence network and bring Santa Blanca's sicarios down to their knees. The world will react differently to each of your choices: unexpected opportunities and threats could arise from any situation.",

            "description": "That giant pile of corpses ahead of you is twitching. You know that's bad news, right? In Metro Exodus pretty much everything that happens is bad news, but a twitching pile of corpses is news of the notably negative type. And, yes, there's a giant mutant mole hungry to eat your face. Shoot it! SHOOT IT!!! Such is a minute in the life of Metro Exodus hero Artyom, surviving in an irradiated Russia 25 years after the world's nations got a bit too trigger-happy with their nukes. Shooting, exploring, and surviving in the face of the ever-growing horror of this harrowingly beautiful world. One bit of good news for Artyom this time out, though, is he's out of the tunnels! This opens up the world of Metro from the claustrophobic underground warrens of previous games to terrifying wetlands, deserts and ruins. There are sprawling stages for you to explore now, with chances to tackle their various slavers, bandits and giant shrimp monsters in whatever way you see fit. It's a world that oozes atmosphere and the stench of death in equal measures. Make sure you keep your wits about you and your gun loaded, or you'll most certainly find yourself in the belly of something with no right to exist.",
